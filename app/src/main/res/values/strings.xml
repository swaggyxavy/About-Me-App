        Hello! My name is Joshua San Jose T. Madroño and this is my About Me page created in Android Studio.
        I am currently learning how to use layouts such as ScrollView, LinearLayout, and TextView.
        This is for my Mobile Applications Development class or ITCC 41 section B.

        I enjoy programming, designing apps, and learning new things about technology especially with Maam Guen!
        In the very near future, I want to build more Android applications with interactive features to have a successful career like Maam Guen.

        If I was a dinosaur, I will rawrrrrrrrrrrrr always!! Hehe
        If I go back 3 years ago, I would still pick me!

        Thank you for very much!
